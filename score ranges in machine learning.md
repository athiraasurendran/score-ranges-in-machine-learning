# Score Ranges in Machine Learning

- Below 70% → Underfitting

  Model too weak, not learning enough.
---

- 70% to 80% → Moderate fit (okay, but not strong)

  Model has learned something, but performance is average.

  Could be improved with better features, tuning, or model choice.
---

- 80% to 90% → Good fit

  Model is strong, generalizes well (if train ≈ test).
---

- Above 90% (with small gap) → Very good fit

  Excellent generalization if test score is also high.
---

- Above 90% train but test much lower (big gap) → Overfitting

  Model memorized training data, failed to generalize.
